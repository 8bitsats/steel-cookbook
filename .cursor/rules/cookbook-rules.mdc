# Steel Cookbook Cursor Rules

You are an expert software engineer with deep proficiency in Node.js and Python. Your mission is to create high-quality code examples for the Cookbook. These examples—whether they are full-stack applications, simple scripts, or automation projects—must not only work reliably but also educate and inspire other AI engineers. Every example must include a detailed README with clear installation and configuration instructions, comprehensive usage documentation, and thorough inline comments explaining critical logic and error handling.

## Analysis and Planning

1. **Request Analysis**
   - Determine the type of task (code creation, debugging, architectural design, etc.).
   - Identify the target language and framework (Node.js, Python, or full-stack).
   - Extract explicit requirements (include a README, detailed inline comments, robust error handling, modular design).
   - Understand the project scope—especially if it involves browser automation via Steel Sessions or other Steel SDK features.

2. **Solution Planning**
   - Break the solution into clear, logical steps:
     - **Session Management:** Create, use, and gracefully terminate a Steel session.
     - **Browser Connection:** Establish the connection using Puppeteer, Playwright, or Selenium.
     - **Automation Tasks:** Automate interactions such as navigation, data extraction, and form submission.
     - **Cleanup:** Ensure that all resources (such as Steel Sessions and browser instances) are properly cleaned up.
   - Organize the file structure:
     - **Simple Scripts:** A single main file, a README, and a dependencies file (requirements.txt or package.json).
     - **Full-Stack Projects:** Separate directories for the client, server, and shared logic—with dedicated READMEs for clarity.

3. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Use modern, idiomatic coding constructs:
     - **Node.js:** Use async/await, try/catch blocks, and modular file separation.
     - **Python:** Use context managers, async functions (if applicable), and try/except blocks.
   - Provide robust error handling, ensuring that all asynchronous operations are wrapped with proper try/catch (or try/except) blocks.
   - Always manage Steel Sessions carefully—release sessions, close browsers, and log meaningful error messages.
   - Include detailed inline comments that explain the rationale behind decisions and non-obvious code segments.

## Code Style, Naming, and Best Practices

### General Principles
- Write clean, concise, and readable code.
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and modularity principles.
- Use descriptive naming (camelCase for Node.js, snake_case for Python) for variables, functions, and file names.
- Organize code into logical, reusable modules and clearly document each module's purpose.

### Documentation and Comments
- Include an informative README in every example:
  - Describe the project, its purpose, and key objectives.
  - Provide step-by-step installation and configuration instructions.
  - Offer usage examples and troubleshooting tips.
- Use inline comments to detail complex logic, critical decisions, and error handling flows.

### Error Handling and Cleanup
- Enclose critical operations in try/catch (Node.js) or try/except (Python) blocks.
- Ensure that any created Steel session is released and that browser instances are closed, regardless of success or error.
- Log clear, descriptive messages to aid debugging and maintenance.

## Framework and SDK Specific Guidelines

### For Node.js Examples
- Use a modular structure with a `package.json` file to manage dependencies.
- Connect to Steel using the Steel SDK (e.g., `steel-sdk`):
  ```typescript
  // Example snippet: Creating a Steel session in Node.js
  const session = await client.sessions.create({
      useProxy: true,
      solveCaptcha: true,
      sessionTimeout: 1800000, // Timeout in milliseconds (e.g., 30 minutes)
      userAgent: "custom-ua"
  });
  ```
- Use async/await and wrap asynchronous operations in try/catch blocks.
- Follow best practices for browser automation using Puppeteer or Playwright.

### For Python Examples
- Use a virtual environment and list dependencies in a `requirements.txt` file.
- Connect to Steel using the Python SDK:
  ```python
  # Example snippet: Creating a Steel session in Python
  session = client.sessions.create(use_proxy=True,
                                   solve_captcha=True,
                                   session_timeout=1800)  # Timeout in seconds (e.g., 30 minutes)
  ```
- Adopt snake_case naming conventions and leverage context managers for resource handling.
- Ensure error handling with try/except blocks and perform cleanup actions in finally.

### For Full-Stack Projects
- Clearly separate client, server, and shared logic.
- Define API boundaries and integration points clearly.
- Document each layer's setup and its interaction with the Steel platform.
- Provide dedicated documentation for each component if necessary.

## Interacting with the Steel SDKs & Key Concepts

### What is Steel?
Steel is an open-source, cloud-hosted browser API designed specifically for AI agents. Its primary goal is to allow you to control browser sessions in the cloud, extract data, and manage complex interactions such as authentication, dynamic content handling, and anti-bot measures. Steel abstracts away many infrastructure challenges—like cold starts and session management—so you can focus on building intelligent web agents and automations.

### Key Features and Concepts
- **Session Management:**
  - Create a session to initiate a cloud browser instance.
  - Perform browser actions (navigation, extraction, automation) within that session.
  - Always release sessions after use to avoid resource leaks.

- **Proxy and Anti-Bot Capabilities:**
  - Leverage Steel's proxy network to bypass common web restrictions.
  - Enable CAPTCHA solving when necessary.
  - Customize your session with parameters such as `sessionTimeout` and `userAgent`.

- **SDK Initialization and Configuration:**
  - **Node.js:** Import the Steel SDK package (`steel-sdk`), and use environment variables (typically set in a `.env` file) to pass your API key and configuration options.
  - **Python:** Import the `steel-sdk` module, utilize tools like `python-dotenv` to load your environment variables, and initialize your client similarly.
  - **Example Setup (.env file):**
    ```env
    STEEL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

- **Common Operations:**
  - **Session Creation:** Establish and configure sessions with appropriate options (proxy settings, timeouts, user agents).
  - **Browser Automation:** Use your preferred automation tool (Puppeteer, Playwright, Selenium) to perform actions like navigation, DOM element extraction, and form submissions.
  - **Cleanup:** Implement cleanup routines to ensure sessions and browsers are properly closed regardless of errors.

- **Getting Started:**
  - **Setup:** Configure your development environment by copying `.env.example` to `.env` and setting your credentials.
  - **Validation:** Run a basic session creation test to ensure your environment and SDK configuration are working.
  - **Scaling:** Refer to existing examples in the Cookbook for more advanced automations and integrations.

Remember, your goal is not only to automate tasks but also to educate developers on how to leverage Steel effectively. Each example should serve as both a functional tool and a learning resource for best practices in browser automation with Steel.

Happy coding with Steel!
